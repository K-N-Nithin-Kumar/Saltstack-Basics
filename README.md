# Saltstack-Basics
SaltStack is an open-source software for configuration management, remote execution, and orchestration of infrastructure. It allows system administrators to manage and automate the configuration and deployment of servers and network devices, as well as the execution of commands and scripts across large numbers of systems.

* SaltStack provides a central repository for storing configuration files and execution modules that can be used to manage and automate the configuration of systems.
* The Salt Master distributes these files to the Salt Minions (servers or devices being managed) and ensures that they are configured correctly.
* SaltStack also allows administrators to execute commands and scripts across many systems simultaneously, which can save time and reduce errors.
* A practical analogy to understand SaltStack is to think of it as a chef who manages a large kitchen with many cooks and many dishes to prepare.
* Just like a chef who needs to ensure that each dish is prepared according to the recipe and delivered to the customer on time, system administrators need to ensure that each system in their infrastructure is configured 
   correctly, running smoothly, and delivering services to end-users efficiently.
* SaltStack helps system administrators to maintain consistency, reduce errors, and save time, just like a chef who manages a large kitchen with many cooks and many dishes to prepare.

## Setting up a Salt environment

Setting up a Salt environment involves creating a working Salt infrastructure that includes a Salt Master server and one or more Salt Minion servers, and configuring them to work together to manage your IT infrastructure.
****************
We'll set up a basic Salt Master - Minion using Docker containers. We'll create 3 containers: one for the Salt master server and another two for the Salt minion servers.
1. Install Docker on Ubuntu distro
   ```
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install docker.io -y
      sudo systemctl start docker
      sudo docker --version
   ```
2. Create configuration files for the Salt master and Salt minion servers. These files define settings such as the IP addresses or hostnames of the Master and Minion servers, the communication protocols to use, the location of SSL certificates, and other relevant parameters.
   ```mkdir -p workspace/saltcfg```
   
   ```cd workspace/saltcfg```
   
   ```vim master-config.conf```
   
   Add below line into the **master-config.conf**
   
   ``interface: 0.0.0.0``

    ---------
   The interface directive is used to specify the network interface the Salt Master should bind to. By setting it to 0.0.0.0, we're telling the Salt Master to bind to all available network interfaces. This allows the Salt Master to be accessible from any IP address, including the Docker containers.

   -------
   Ensure you are in the ```workspace/saltcfg``` Directory and create config file for minions.
   
   ```vim minion-config.conf```

   Add below line to minion-config.conf file

   ```master: salt-master```

   ----
   The master directive is used to specify the hostname or IP address of the Salt Master server. In our case, we set it to salt-master, which will be the service name of the docker container which will be created in next steps. Docker's internal DNS resolver will automatically resolve this service name to the IP address of the Salt Master container. This way, the Salt Minion knows where to find the Salt Master.
     
   ------

3. Create Docker images for Salt Master and Minions. First, create a Dockerfile for the Salt Master:
   
   ```vim Dockerfile.master```
   Copy below code snippet.

   ```
   FROM ubuntu:18.04
   
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install -y salt-master nano
   
   COPY master-config.conf /etc/salt/master
   
   EXPOSE 4505 4506
   
   CMD ["salt-master", "-l", "info"]
   ```

   Now, create a Dockerfile for the Salt Minions:

   ```vim Dockerfile.minion```
   Copy below code snippet.

   ```
   FROM ubuntu:18.04
   
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install -y salt-minion
   
   COPY minion-config.conf /etc/salt/minion
   
   CMD ["salt-minion", "-l", "info"]
   ```
   The /etc/salt/ directory contains the Salt configuration files, including the master and minion configuration files.

4. Build Docker images. In the ~/workspace/saltcfg directory containing the Dockerfile.master and Dockerfile.minion, run these commands:
   ```
     sudo docker build -t salt-master -f Dockerfile.master .
   ```

   ```
     sudo docker build -t salt-minion -f Dockerfile.minion .
   ```
   
5. Create a custom Docker network to allow the Salt Master and Minions to communicate with each other.
   
    ```
     sudo docker network create salt-network
    
    ```

6. Run Salt Master container
   
   ```   
    sudo docker run -d --name salt-master --network salt-network -p 4505:4505 -p 4506:4506 salt-master
   
   ```
7.Run a few Salt Minion containers:

   ```
     sudo docker run -d --name salt-minion-1 --network salt-network salt-minion
   ```
   ```
     sudo docker run -d --name salt-minion-2 --network salt-network salt-minion
   ```
